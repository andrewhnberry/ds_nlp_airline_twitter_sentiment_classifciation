# ds_nlp_airline_twitter_sentiment_classifciation
 
### Project
My take on the classic kaggle dataset of tweets towards various airlines, within the dataset we are provided with the tweet itself as well as the labeled sentiment too that tweet. With that information available, I wanted to produce a few basic machine learning models to predict that sentiment accuratley. 

### Purpose 
This is a personal project, I really wanted to explore my data science skills, understand deeper the various machine learning algortihims, as well as to imporve on my data analysis work

## The Work 

The project will be attempted and explored through Jupyter Notebooks and it is labeled accordingly. 

1. Basic Explatory Analysis (Partially Completed)
2. Predicing Sentiment with SKLEARN (Partially Completed)
3. Deep Learning with Keras (Uncopmleted)

## Results



### Future
Over time I will like to improve on all 3 of these notebooks.

1. Add more Machine Learning Models to notebook 2.
2. Improve Explatory Analysis, with improved graphs, in depth storytelling
3. Do a comparision but with Spacey instead of NLTK
